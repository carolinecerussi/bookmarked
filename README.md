# Book Marked
## The Book Sharing App for friends
### By Caroline Cerussi

## Description:

This application is a library creator that allows users to input a book that they are interested in reading, have read and want to share with their group.  It has CRUD functionality- allowing the user to create a new book, including a full description with a few different properties. When adding the new information, you are redirected to the home page, where you will see an alphabetical list of the books entered by you and your friends. Click each to see information - including book title, author, price, review/description, genre, and star rating. Also, let us know if you've read it or not.  A sell method changes the stars -1 each time a bag is sold. At any time, you can edit the information within the coffee bean type, or delete the whole object altogether from the log.
